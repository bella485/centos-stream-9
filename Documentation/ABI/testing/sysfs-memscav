What:		/sys/kernel/memscav
Date:		October 2023
KernelVersion:	RHEL-only
Description:
		Interface to control memory scavenging options. Memory past the
		limited amount instructed to the kernel can be recovered using
		the platform description.
		This is similar to what CONFIG_ARCH_MEMORY_PROBE allows, with
		some additional simple checks.
		(see Documentation/admin-guide/mm/memory-hotplug.rst)

What:		/sys/kernel/memscav/probe
Date:		October 2023
KernelVersion:	RHEL-only
Description:
		Write-only. Similar to /sys/devices/system/memory/probe.
		Does not perform any sanity check, it is therefore possible to
		create a virtual mapping to memory that does not exist. For
		debug and experimentation only.
		(see Documentation/admin-guide/mm/memory-hotplug.rst)

What:		/sys/kernel/memscav/ranges
Date:		October 2023
KernelVersion:	RHEL-only
Description:
		Read-only. Reports the known physical ranges for RAM as reported by the
		platform (device-tree or UEFI memory map) to the kernel.

What:		/sys/kernel/memscav/scavenge
Date:		October 2023
KernelVersion:	RHEL-only
Description:
		Write-only. Takes an amount of bytes and tries to recover
		physical memory reported during boot but excluded by the kernel
		(for example, by the parameter "mem=X").
		Fails with EINVAL if the amount given is not a multiple of
		/sys/devices/system/memory/block_size_bytes.
		This will scavenge as much memory as possible, but there is no
		guaranty that the total amount will be scavenged.
		/sys/kernel/memscav/hidden_blocks will show if any memory block is
		still hidden.

What:		/sys/kernel/memscav/hidden_blocks
Date:		October 2023
KernelVersion:	RHEL-only
Description:
		Read-only. Reports blocks of physical addresses currently hidden from the system.
		When using /sys/kernel/memscav/scavenge, the recovered memory will be
		taken per block-size from these ranges.
