=== GitLab ‘lab’ and ‘bichon’ & Go

The recommended tools (bichon and lab) are written in go.  The tools are packaged as RPMs and are available from https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[COPR].  Instructions on installing the RPMs from COPR are provided in the link:bichon.adoc[bichon] sections below.

Users wishing to use a bleeding edge version of bichon or lab, must install the widely used go compiler and executable in their environments.
